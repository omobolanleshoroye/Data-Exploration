# Data-Exploration
I analysed and explored a Covid-19 dataset using PostgreSQL 15 to gain key insights such as the likelihood of dying if you contact the virus, the percentage of the population in countries that contacted the virus, the total population in countries versus the number of people vaccinated and a lot more. 

I utilised the join statement, aggregate functions, CTE, created a temp table and created several views for data visualisation in Tableau.
